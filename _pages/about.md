Research Interest
------
I am interested in all aspects of computer security; as I am in early stage of my career, I am trying to find my niche.
In general, I want to improve digital security and privacy by creating tools or OS constructs for the development of
 secure software, building systems that make the internet safer, and conducting studies that reveal
 security issues in online platforms.

I like participating in security competitions, like Capture the Flag (CTF) and blue team
competitions, permiting time. I play CTF with KernelSanders (UF Security Information Security team)
and help it host SwampCTF.
