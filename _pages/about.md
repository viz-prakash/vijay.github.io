Research Interest
------
I am interested in all aspects of computer security; as I am in early stage of my career, I am trying to find my niche.
 In particular, I would like to build tools or OS constructs to help in building
 secure softwares, building systems to make
 internet little bit more safe, and conduct empirical studies to find out flaws
 in online platforms. I have also curiosity towards applied cryptography.

I like participating in security competitions, like Capture the Flag (CTF) and blue team
competitions, permiting time. I play CTF with KernelSanders (UF Security Information Security team)
and help it host SwampCTF.
